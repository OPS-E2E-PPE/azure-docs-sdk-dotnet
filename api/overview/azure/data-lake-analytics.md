# Azure Data Lake Analytics libraries for .NET

## Overview

Azure Data Lake Analytics is an on-demand analytics job service to simplify big data analytics. You can focus on writing, running, and managing jobs rather than on operating distributed infrastructure. Instead of deploying, configuring, and tuning hardware, you write queries to transform your data and extract valuable insights. The analytics service can handle jobs of any scale instantly by setting the dial for how much power you need. You only pay for your job when it is running, making it cost-effective. The analytics service supports Azure Active Directory letting you manage access and roles, integrated with your on-premises identity system. It also includes U-SQL, a language that unifies the benefits of SQL with the expressive power of user code. This scalable distributed runtime enables you to efficiently analyze data in the store. It operates across SQL Servers in Azure, Azure SQL Database, and Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

## Management library

Use the management library to connect to the service and manage analytics jobs.

Install the [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.DataLake.Analytics) directly from the Visual Studio [Package Manager console][PackageManager] or with the [.NET Core CLI][DotNetCLI].

#### Visual Studio Package Manager

```powershell
Install-Package Microsoft.Azure.Management.DataLake.Analytics
```

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Management.DataLake.Analytics
```

### Code Example

This example creates the clients to connect with and manage the analytics account.

```csharp
/*
using AdlClient 
*/

// Setup authentication for this demo
Authentication auth = new Authentication("microsoft.onmicrosoft.com"); // change this to YOUR tenant
auth.Authenticate();

// Identify the accounts
AnalyticsAccountRef adla_account = new AnalyticsAccountRef(subscriptionId, resourceGroup, userName);

// Create the clients
AzureClient az = new AzureClient(auth);
AnalyticsClient adla = new AnalyticsClient(auth, adla_account);
```
