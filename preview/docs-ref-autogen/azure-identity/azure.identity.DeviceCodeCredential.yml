  summary: 'Authenticates users through the device code flow.


    When <xref:azure.identity.get_token> is called, this credential acquires a verification
    URL and code from Azure Active Directory.

    A user must browse to the URL, enter the code, and authenticate with Azure Active
    Directory. If the user

    authenticates successfully, the credential receives an access token.


    For more information about the device code flow, see Azure Active Directory documentation:
